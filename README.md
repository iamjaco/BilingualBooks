Scripts to combine 2 books

The script merge.py combines the sample files into one book containing alternating chapters.
The script merge_par.py combines the sample files into one book containing alternating paragraphs.

Both scripts make use of the ebooklib library and merge_par additionally uses BeautifulSoup for parsing the html files.
